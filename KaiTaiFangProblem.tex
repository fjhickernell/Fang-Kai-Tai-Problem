Dear Fred:
 
In the past years we find that QMC can be used for statistical inference. In many situation it can significantly improve
Monte Caro simulation. Please find attached two papers for your reference.  For our simulation we can see potential 
application of QMC, but it needs to prove the consistency of estimates by QMC.  Currently, two of my postgraduate 
students have tried to prove the consistency of estimates by representative points under MSE (minimum square error).
If your students are interesting to prove the consistency of estimates by QMC, we can have a close cooperation by 
the net seminar. 

 Merry Christmas
 
 Kai-Tai
